<h1 align="center">⚡ Storm Framework FLOW</h1>

Storm is a web-based framework **Stateful REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)** designed with an isolated modular architecture. This framework uses SQLite as *embedded database* for state management, session tracking, and internal logging, ensuring data consistency across the execution cycle.

## 🏗️ FLOW & Booting Sequence

When the command `storm` executed, A *global wrapper* will trigger the script *startup* on *root directory* to start the process *booting* a system consisting of 4 critical stages:

1. **Core Verification**: Ensuring the integrity of the framework's core components.
2. **Module Synchronization (SQLite)**: Melakukan scanning otomatis pada direktori modul. Jika ditemukan perubahan, data metadata modul langsung disinkronisasikan ke dalam SQLite.
3. **Binary Loading (SQLite)**: Loading all *compiled binaries* both from the core and modules into the SQLite.
4. **Integrity Check**: Perform verification *cryptographic checksum* or internal validation to ensure no binaries are corrupted or illegally modified.

After the boot phase is successful, the user will be faced with **Main Interface** (minimalist UI/UX: banner, system statistics, update checker, and *command prompt* main).

## 🎮 Core REPL Commands

The Storm interface is divided into two main scopes: **Global Scope** And **Module Scope**.

### 1. Session Management Commands
* `help` : Displays command documentation and syntax guides.
* `about` : Displaying framework metadata (version, organization, ownership, etc.).
* `clear` : Clearing the terminal screen.
* `back` : Out of *Module Scope* and back to *Global Scope*.
* `exit` : Safely terminate a REPL session (*graceful shutdown*).

### 2. Operational & State Mutator Commands

#### 🔍 `search [filter]`
Perform direct queries to SQLite to search for modules by name or specific parameters.
* **Syntax:** `search <keyword>` or combined with a filter, example: `search defaction:network action:scan`

#### 📂 `use <module_path>`
(*lock*) REPL context to a specific module. Behind the scenes, Storm pulls module configurations and schemas directly from a SQLite database that is always updated at boot time.

#### ⚙️ `set <variable> <value>`
Inserting data into runtime variables. 
* **Global Validation Layer:** Storm will check if the variable is valid. If it is invalid, the system gives a *warning* without stopping the REPL.
* **State Persistence:** Variables are implemented globally. You can switch modules without losing any data that has been `set`.
* **Hot-Restart Cache Mechanism:** If the system restarts, Storm automatically saves active variables into a *temporary cache* in SQLite. On reboot, this cache is loaded back into memory and then removed from the database, keeping your data persistent.

#### 🚀 `run`
Executes the currently locked module. The internal process of this command goes through several stages. (*Pre-flight Checks*):
1. **Lock Validation:** Ensure the user has executed the command `use`.
2. **Mandatory Options Check:** Ensure all variables required by the module are filled in (Storm focuses on filling in variables, not validating raw data types like IP vs URL).
3. **Data Injection:** Data is passed to the module, and execution control is transferred to the module runtime.
4. **Signal Interception (`Ctrl+C`):** If the module is stuck, pressing `Ctrl+C` will send `SIGINT` to force stop the module and return direct control to the main **Storm prompt**.

## 🛡️ Fault Tolerance & Module Isolation

Storm implements **Loose Coupling Architecture**. The main modules and frameworks only interact through **Contract API Interface**.  
If a module receives invalid input (for example URL inside IP variable) and experience *crash*, the failure **will not have any impact** on the main framework. Storm will stay alive, keeping your REPL session uninterrupted.

## 📊 Telemetry & Internal Logging

To maintain cleanliness *interface*, Storm doesn't flood the screen with details *stack trace* if it happens *error*. All operation logs are stored internally within SQLite.

Users can export the logs at any time using the command:
* `export log error`
* `export log info`
* `export log warn`
* `export log critical`
* `export log debug`

Log files will be generated automatically with standard format `.txt` and saved in the directory:
`$HOME/storm_logs/...`
