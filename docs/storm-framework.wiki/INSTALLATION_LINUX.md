# 🛠️ Installation Linux Storm Framework

For this Linux installation, it is actually an installation with an old version in a standard Linux environment, this will use commands like `--break-system-packages` while running `pip` which actually carries the risk of conflict with the Python dependencies used by the Linux system.

However, we still provide this option in case some users prefer installing using this legacy method. That said, we strongly recommend using a Virtual Machine (VM) when installing this way for better safety, or alternatively using other methods we have already provided **Venv/Docker.**
