# 🛠️ Installation Venv Storm Framework

This installation follows the standard recommended by Python. Since Storm is Python-based, we implement Storm installation using a virtual environment (venv) because it is safer. This ensures that dependencies and packages are isolated within a virtual space without affecting the global `site-packages`, which is what we highly recommend for you.

## 📖 Storm Framework Installation Steps

### 1. Repository Clone & Automated Installation

This URL will run the installation automatically, including creating Venv and so on, you just have to wait for it to finish.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StormWorld0/storm-framework/main/setupvenv | bash
```

### 2. Execute Command

This is the command to run Storm.

```bash
sudo storm
```

### 3. External Update Command

Allows updates outside the Storm interface without having to startup.

```bash
sudo storm --update
```

### 4. Copy Storm Trusted Root CA

This Root CA can be copied from internal to `$HOME` and is usually used when you want to run a module `https_proxy`, the command is as below:

```bash
storm --cp --crt
```

Alternative:

```bash
sudo storm --cp --crt
```

After finishing copying CA to `$HOME` use the following command to insert into the trust store certificate:

```bash
sudo cp smf_ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/smf_ca.crt
```

Then confirm with the command:

```bash
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

You can also install Storm Trust Root CA to Firefox Browser and so on.
